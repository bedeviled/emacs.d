Vendor packages
- Install color-theme from
  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/color-theme/.  Unzip and
  put color-theme.el in vendor and color-theme-example.el and
  color-theme-library.el in vendor/thems
- themes/twilight-emacs - theme used by defunkt -  git submodule from
  git://github.com/crafterm/twilight-emacs.git
- nav - Emacs Nav package - mercurial project on google code, hg clone
  https://emacs-nav.googlecode.com/hg/ emacs-nav, not committing .hg
  file, so you must clone it yourself
- magit - Magical Git for Emacs - git submodule from from
  http://github.com/philjackson/magit, say you need to install, but
  seems to work fine as is
- paredit - wget'd from http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el,
  current version is 21
- slime - I cheated here.  I installed ESK in a separate .emac.d
  directory.  ESK is at
  http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit  I then  used M-x
  package-list-packages to install both slime and slime-repl.  Then
  copied those packages from elpa directory to my directory.  Too hard
  to mess with any longer
