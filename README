This is my personal emacs config.  I started with ideas from the emacs-starter-kit, the aquamacs-starter-kit , defunkt's emacs config and others.  Then I got frustrated with the portability and started again, taking things I liked from the current config.  It is based heavily on Steve Purcell's config at https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.  At one point, I used el-get for package management. But with the recent focus on elpa, specifically marmalade, I have redone the config to use that.  ELPA packages are checked into the git to help me monitor changes and speed up getting starting from a new clone.

I was a huge vim user for decades.  Org-mode and the swank for Clojure finally got me to buckle down and learn emacs.

None of this is my own innovation.  I simply spent a lot of time reading other people's configs and pulling what would work for me.  I use multi-term and mostly do not have a seperate terminal app open.  I use git, but not with a package.  It is all through the terminal.  I am particular about whitespace and formatting, so that is configured strictly.

This config is used everyday on my mac and occasionaly in linux.  Start with the init.el and then init-elpa.el and you should be able to follow what is being loaded and configured.

To help starting emacs from the commandline, I created the following script named ec, which is on my path
#!/bin/sh
for f in $@; do
    if [ ! -e ${f} ]; then
        touch ${f}
    fi
done

/usr/local/Cellar/emacs/23.3b/bin/emacsclient -n $@ 2> /dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    open -a ${HOME}/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs $@
fi

I have the following environment variables configured
export EDITOR="emacs --no-init"
export GIT_EDITOR="emacsclient" #hit Ctrl-x # to end in terminal

I use emacs for just about everything, including development in the following.
- Ruby/Rails, with rvm
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Groovy
- Java
- Clojure
- PHP
- Java
- Shell scripts
