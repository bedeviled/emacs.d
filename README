This is my personal emacs config.  I started with ideas from the emacs-starter-kit, the aquamacs-starter-kit , defunkt's emacs config and others and built it from the ground up.  Then I got frustrated with the portability and started again, taking things I liked from the current config.  It is based heavily on Steve Purcell's config at https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d and uses el-get for package management. See https://github.com/dimitri/el-get.

I was a huge vim user for decades and had been using TextMate for a couple of years.  Org-mode and the swank for Clojure finally got me to buckle down and learn emacs.

None of this is my own innovation.  I simply spent a lot of time reading other people's configs and pulling what would work for me.  I use multi-term and mostly do not have a seperate terminal app open.  I use git, but not with a package.  It is all through the terminal.  I am particular about whitespace and formatting, so that is configured strictly.

This config is used everyday on my mac and occasionaly in linux.  Start with the init.el and init-el-get.el and you should be able to follow what is being loaded and configured.  I use emacs for just about everything, including development in the following

- Ruby/Rails, with rvm
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Groovy
- Java
- Clojure
- PHP
- Java
