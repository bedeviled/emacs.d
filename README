This is my personal emacs config.  I have taken ideas from the emacs-starter-kit, the aquamacs-starter-kit , defunkt's emacs config and others.  This config is build from the ground up because I needed to understand how this was working.

Seems to work on both GNU Emacs 23 and Aquamacs 2.1 on Snow Leopard.

There is still work to be done, but currently it is functional for developing clojure with slime



Vendor packages:  Where these can be found in git, you will need to add the submodules.  Anything else is committed along with the project
- Install color-theme from
  http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/color-theme/.  Unzip and
  put color-theme.el in vendor and color-theme-example.el and
  color-theme-library.el in vendor/themes
- themes/twilight-emacs - theme used by defunkt -  git submodule from
  git://github.com/crafterm/twilight-emacs.git
- nav - Emacs Nav package - mercurial project on google code, hg clone
  https://emacs-nav.googlecode.com/hg/ emacs-nav, not committing .hg
  file, so you must clone it yourself
- magit - Magical Git for Emacs - git submodule from from
  http://github.com/philjackson/magit, say you need to install, but
  seems to work fine as is
- paredit - wget'd from http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.el,
  current version is 21
- slime - git submodule from git://git.boinkor.net/slime.git.  Worked
  first time adding to autoloads
- clojure-mode - gitsubmodule from
  http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode.git
- vivid chalk color theme - wget from
  http://github.com/evangineer/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit/blob/master/site-lisp/vivid-chalk/vivid-chalk.el
- zenburn color theme - wget from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/zenburn.el
- anything in prep for grails mode - wget's http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/anything-config.el and http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/anything.el - grails-emacs-mode - wget all files from https://svn.codehaus.org/groovy/trunk/groovy/ide/emacs/.  Have aspirations of making grails command to execute test for current file, but will make a seperate project on github if I do.  This works for now.
- php-mode - wget'd from http://php-mode.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/php-mode/tags/php-mode-1.5.0/php-mode.el
- nxhtml - git submodule from http://github.com/emacsmirror/nxhtml.git
- twittering-mode - git submodule from git://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode.git
- java - using malabar mode.  Get it from http://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode and run mvn package.  Then unzip the dist in ~/.emacs.d/vendor
- dired-single from http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/dired-single.el
- project-root.el - pulled in from https://github.com/emacsmirror/project-root
- ack.el - for use with project-root from http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/content/emacs.html
- figlet.el - also from http://www.shellarchive.co.uk/content/emacs.html, just because it looks fun.  Had to brew install figlet and modify the .el to point to the right place
- rainbow-delimiters from http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters, hooked in elisp.
- drap and drop on a mac, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1850292/emacs-23-1-and-mac-os-x-problem-with-files-drag-and-drop and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1850292/emacs-23-1-and-mac-os-x-problem-with-files-drag-and-drop
- org-mode as a submodule for latest.  Git submodule add git://repo.or.cz/org-mode.git vendor/org-mode.  Cd to vendor/org-mode, then git checkout -b stable origin/maint.  Run make && make doc && make install
- haml-mode from https://github.com/nex3/haml/raw/da9ed66cd49d8c9fc63420378d159997934ac7ea/extra/haml-mode.el
